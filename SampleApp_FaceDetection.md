This sample application shows the Haar cascade object detection algorithm. For a complete discussion about the method, the application and the history behind this method is also shown in the CodeProject competition winner article [Haar-feature Object Detection in C#](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/441226/Haar-feature-Object-Detection-in-Csharp).
